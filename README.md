# Computer-networks-project-1
Christopher Rayas submission for Project 1 in Computer Networks CS 4392 Section 001 at Texas Tech University

This github repository is my attempt of completion of Project 1 of Computer Networks class CS 4392.

I ran into a number of issues while attempting to complete this project, but I will at least start off with what I think I correctly. I 
believe that my client code was able to connect to my own server. I ran into difficulties however, getting the server to respond back. I first
started coding through an online compiler repl.it, but then switched to a shell/IDLE compiler run on my personal machine. I believe it is
because of running my code through a shell that I was running into so many problems with my code, as I had assistance by a friend whose code was
working but they were using an interpreter. I found that I was running out of time to switch coding environments so I did my best to make do
with what was available to me.

Another issue I was running into was that my server code as it was trying to connect to my server, which I created with puTTY and using Google
cloud platform, seemed to keep stalling during execution of the code. Again I unsure exactly what my issue was as I was made to believe my code
should work based on the resources I was following. I had difficulty obtaining the pcap file as I was having issues with Wireshark. Downloading
Wireshark caused my computer to crash multiple times and I am pretty sure that somehow damaged my computer's bluetooth driver. I am not sure
how it did that, I just know that I was still able to connect my wireless mouse and headphones to my laptop before I downloaded Wireshark.

In conclusion, while this project is not how I would have liked for it to come out, I cannot deny that I have become more accustomed to
computer network principles through the exposure of attempting this project. I have become more familiar with server/client programming using 
Python and have better understanding of how clients and servers should communicate. I hope to use what I have learned here to preform better on future projects and assignments.
